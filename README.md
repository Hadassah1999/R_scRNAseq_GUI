# scRNAseq analysis GUI using R

**GUI Overview:**
This project provides an interactive R Shiny GUI for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data. The interface is organized into modular components, making it easy to follow the standard scRNA-seq analysis workflow:

* Upload Module – Supports input of raw count data in 10X Genomics (folder format) or H5 files. Users can add multiple samples and assign custom names.

* QC & Filtering Module – Allows quality control by filtering low-quality cells/genes using customizable thresholds.

* Normalization & Scaling – Implements different normalization strategies (e.g., Log, CLR, RC) and optional scaling for downstream analysis.

* Dimensionality Reduction – Performs PCA and visualizes results, with tools like the Elbow Plot to guide PC selection.

* Clustering - Perform clustering of cells to identify distinct populations and visualize them in reduced dimensions (e.g., PCA/UMAP).

* Cell Annotation - Annotate clusters based on known biological information or reference datasets to assign meaningful cell types.

* Gene Highlighting - Highlight and visualize the expression of specific genes across clusters and conditions.

* Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) - Identify and explore marker genes by running DEG analysis between selected groups of cells.

## How to run the program

Fisrt, clone or download the repository to your PC.<br>
Before running the program, make sure that R environment is installed.<br>
All other required libraries will be installed automatically when the app is run, if they are not already present.<br><br>

**Running the program on Windows:**

In the main folder of the repository, you can find a ```scRNAseq.bat``` file.<br>
One double click on this folder, would launch and open the app.<br><br>

**Running the program on MacOS:**

In the main folder of the repository, you can find a ```scRNAseq.command``` file.<br>
When you first try to run the script, macOS Gatekeeper may show this warning:<br>
> “Apple could not verify `scRNAseq.command` is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.”

This happens because the file is not signed by an identified developer. If you trust the script, follow one of the methods below (if not, see the alternative way):

Option A – Allow via System Settings:

1. Double-click ```scRNAseq.command``` once (see the warning, then close it).
2. Open 'System Settings' → 'Privacy & Security'.
3. Scroll to the 'Security' section.
4. Click “Allow Anyway” next to ```scRNAseq.command```.
5. Run the file again and click “Open” when prompted.

Option B – Allow via ```Terminal```:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the following commands, replacing `/path/to/` with the file's real location:
   ```bash
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/scRNAseq.command
   chmod +x /path/to/scRNAseq.command

After clearing the Gatekeeper block, you can simply double-click scRNAseq.command at any time.<br>
This will automatically start the app or analysis environment without requiring Terminal commands.

(Optional) Create a Desktop Shortcut:<br>
If you want to launch the app directly from your Desktop:<br>
1. Right-click on ```scRNAseq.command```. <br>
2. Select Make Alias.<br>
3. Move the alias to your Desktop.<br>
4. Double-click the alias to open the app quickly.<br>

**Alternatively:** <br>
If you prefer not to use the executable files, you can open the repository in your R IDE and manually run the app by clicking ```Run App``` in the app.R file. <br><br>

Once you launch the app, the following screen should appear in your browser:

<br>Now, you can proceed with your analysis according to the data type.

## Uploading data

**The GUI supports scRNA-seq data in three formats: .rds, 10X, and .h5. <br>**
After selecting the data type, provide the path to your dataset. <br><br>
The path must follow this format: ```your\path\to\data.rds```<br><br>
**Important:** Make sure the file path contains no spaces or parentheses.<br>
You can easily copy the correct path by right-clicking the file and selecting "Copy as path" (Windows).

## How to process 10X or H5 files
<img width="1492" height="714" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd249156-71c2-4904-acb5-29082f4ed268" />

This is the first step in the workflow for raw data.<br>
In this tab, you can:
- Upload one or more raw samples<br>
    Supported formats:<br>
   - 10X Genomics directory<br>
   -  H5 file<br>
- Assign sample names for easier tracking.<br>
- Add per-sample metadata.

Once your paths and metadata are set, click "Create & Present Seurat Object" to load the data.

>⚠️ Important:
Avoid loading extremely large datasets on computers with limited memory. The QC, normalization, and clustering steps involve heavy calculations, and oversized objects may cause the app to hang or crash.

### Requirements for 10X Genomics Directory

When uploading **10X data**, the folder you select **must contain exactly these three files**:

- `barcodes.tsv.gz`  
- `features.tsv.gz`  
- `matrix.mtx.gz`

After this, follow the steps **in order**, starting with Step 1: Visualize & Filter data and continuing through normalization, PCA and clustering.

### Step 1: Visualize & Filter Data (QC)

After creating the Seurat object, proceed to the **"Step 1: Visualize & Filter Data"** tab.

Here you can:
- **Inspect quality metrics** for each cell:
  - `nFeature_RNA` (number of detected genes)
  - `percent.mt` (percentage of mitochondrial genes)
- **Visualize data** with violin plots for better threshold selection.
- **Filter low-quality cells** interactively by adjusting the sliders or entering custom thresholds.

Once filtering is applied, the updated Seurat object will be used in all subsequent steps.

> **Tip:** Use conservative thresholds to avoid losing biologically relevant cells.

---

### Step 2: Normalization

In the **"Step 2: Normalization"** tab, you can choose one of the available normalization methods:
Optional **scaling** is available to standardize gene expression for PCA and clustering.

---

### Step 3: PCA

The **"Step 3: PCA"** tab provides:
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality.
- **Elbow Plot** to guide the selection of an optimal number of PCs.

> **Tip:** The Elbow Plot helps identify where the variance explained by additional PCs starts to flatten out.

---

### Step 4: Dimension Reduction & Clustering

In this step:
- Run **UMAP** for advanced dimensionality reduction.
- Perform clustering with adjustable resolution parameters.
- Visualize clusters interactively to explore distinct cell populations.

---

### Step 5: Export & Proceed Analysis

Once the preprocessing workflow is complete, you can:
- **Export the updated Seurat object** as an ```.rds``` file for further use.
- Proceed to **annotation, gene highlighting, or DEG analysis** using the processed data.

## How to process .rds files

In the main upload screen, select .rds data type, insert path to data and press ```Load Data```.<br>
The main analysis page would appear:<br><br>

<br>

Use the navbar at the top of the page to navigate between the different analysis pages:
* Cell annotation - Possible for Human or mouse samples
* Gene highlighting - Main analysis page
* Differentially expressed genes
* rds Download - Download updated version of .rds file
